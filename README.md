Welcome! Here I will put any resources I create for mathematics which may be useful to others.

#FAQ

## What is LaTeX?
LaTeX is the way that most mathematical and scientific documents are written at a high level. It allows complete control over formatting, but most importantly enforces consistency where possible. On top of this, it is easy to embed mathematics into the documents seamlessly. I will use TiKz extensively for drawing diagrams, even where impractical, because I really like TiKz and everything it does. 

## Who am I?
I am me! I code sometimes (mostly in C, sometimes in Rust), but importantly to this project I have a master's degree in mathematics. My main interests mathematically are in differential geometry and its applications to mechanics. My dissertation was on Symmetry in Hamiltonian Systems, mostly using sources by Marsden and Ratiu, with the final result being a look into the stability of rigid bodies in SO(4) (highly recommend a look if differential geometry is your thing, see the paper by Birtea, Casu, Ratiu, Turhan).
